**Network Packet Crafting and Generation Library**

CORD-CRAFT is the packet crafting and generation component of the [PacketCord.io](https://github.com/packetcord/packetcord.io) framework. This library will provide comprehensive tools for creating, manipulating, and injecting network packets for testing, development, and analysis purposes.

---

## 🎯 Planned Features

### 📦 Packet Generation
- **Protocol-aware packet creation** - Generate valid packets for various network protocols
- **Template-based crafting** - Use predefined templates for common packet types
- **Custom packet assembly** - Build packets from scratch with fine-grained control

### 🔧 Traffic Simulation
- **Traffic pattern generation** - Simulate realistic network traffic patterns
- **Load testing utilities** - Generate high-volume traffic for performance testing
- **Protocol compliance testing** - Validate network implementations

### 🎪 Integration Capabilities
- **CORD-FLOW integration** - Seamless packet injection via FlowPoint abstractions
- **CORD-CRYPTO integration** - Built-in encryption and security for crafted packets
- **Testing framework support** - Integration with network testing and validation tools
